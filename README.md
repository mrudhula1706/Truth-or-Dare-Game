# Truth-or-Dare-Game
The basic idea of this project is a truth or dare game developed in a virtual environment like python idle shell . Here, we imported Python Tkinter package to enhance the features. It works like a website where there is no involvement of the interpreter or compiler. We used PyCharm environment for implementing our project. We can even achieve this in visual studio environment too.
